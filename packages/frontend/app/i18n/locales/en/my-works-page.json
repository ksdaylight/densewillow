    "description-hi-ni":"This initiative revolves around the development of a sophisticated web application consisting of three distinct projects. The front end, built with Next.js and React, stands as a dynamic user-facing interface. Simultaneously, the admin system, powered by Vben, operates independently to manage the application effectively.  The design aesthetics are further elevated through the use of UI libraries such as Ant Design Mobile, MUI, and Taro UI.\n\nOn the backend, NestJS takes center stage, orchestrating a secure, scalable, and modular architecture. This robust foundation not only fortifies the application against potential security threats but also ensures adaptability to varying scalability requirements.\n\nThe Vben Admin System is implemented to enhance the user experience, enriching the overall look and feel of both the user-facing and admin interfaces. .\n\nAcknowledging the diversity of the user base, the project embraces internationalization (i18n) principles, ensuring inclusive navigation for users with diverse linguistic backgrounds.\n\nThe CI/CD pipeline is meticulously orchestrated through Gitea and Drone, streamlining continuous integration and continuous deployment processes. This ensures a smooth and efficient development lifecycle, facilitating swift iterations and updates across the interconnected projects.\n\nIn terms of the technology stack, the front end leverages Next.js, React, and Vben, while the backend is powered by NestJS. UI libraries such as Ant Design Mobile, MUI, and Taro UI contribute to the rich visual experience. State management is efficiently handled through Redux Toolkit and React-Redux, ensuring a seamless flow of data. Axios and SWR are employed for efficient data fetching, while TypeScript, Sass, ESLint, and Prettier collectively contribute to code quality, maintainability, and a streamlined development experience.\n\nThis project intricately combines cutting-edge technologies across its three interconnected facets, resulting in a web application that not only meets high standards of functionality but also prioritizes user experience and maintainability. The outcome is a modern, responsive, and feature-rich application catering to diverse user needs across its frontend, backend, and server API.",

    "description-discount":"This project is a collaborative work that involves three sub-projects, each using different technologies and frameworks to create a comprehensive and functional web application. The project covers the following aspects:\n\n- NestJs: This is the back-end API server that handles the business logic and data processing of the web application. It uses NestJS, a TypeScript-based framework that provides a scalable and modular architecture for building server-side applications. It also uses Fastify as the web server framework, BullMQ as the job queue library, TypeORM as the ORM library, and Elasticsearch as the search engine.One notable advantage is the incorporation of Yargs to implement a custom CLI. This feature proves invaluable for tasks such as database migration and data population, allowing for a streamlined and efficient management of the application's database operations.\n\n- Next.js-Taoke: This is the front-end user-facing application that provides a dynamic and responsive user interface for the visitors and customers of the web application. It uses Next.js, a React-based framework that supports server-side rendering, file-system routing, and API routes. It also uses MUI, DaisyUI, and Swiper as UI libraries, TailwindCSS as the CSS framework, and MobX and SWR as the state and data management libraries. \n\n- Ant Design Pro: This is the front-end management dashboard that provides a beautiful and interactive user interface for the administrators and operators of the web application. It uses Ant Design Pro, a React-based UI library that offers a rich set of components and templates. It also uses Axios for making HTTP requests. MobX for state management, and SWR for data fetching and caching.\n\n- CI/CD:The CI/CD pipeline is meticulously orchestrated through Gitea and Drone, streamlining continuous integration and continuous deployment processes. This ensures a smooth and efficient development lifecycle, facilitating swift iterations and updates across the interconnected projects.",
